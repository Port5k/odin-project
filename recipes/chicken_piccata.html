                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Prepare the chicken cutlets:</h3>
                        <p>To make chicken cutlets, slice the chicken breast halves horizontally, butterflying them
                            open. If the breast pieces you are working with are large, you may want to cut them each
                            into two pieces.<br>if the pieces are still thick after butterflying, put them between two
                            pieces of plastic wrap and pound them with a meat hammer to 1/4-inch thickness.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Dredge the cutlets:
                        </h3>
                        <p>Mix together the flour, salt, pepper, and grated Parmesan. Rinse the chicken pieces in water.
                            Dredge them thoroughly in the flour mixture until well coated.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Brown the cutlets:
                        </h3>
                        <p>Heat olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet on medium high heat. Add
                            half of the chicken pieces, do not crowd the pan. Brown well on each side, about 3 minutes
                            per side. Remove the chicken from the pan and reserve to a plate.

                            Cook the other breasts in the same manner, remove from pan. Place the breasts on a rack over
                            a roasting pan and keep warm in a 225Â°F oven while you prepare the sauce.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Add the stock (or wine), lemon juice, and capers:</h3>
                        <p>Add the chicken stock (or white wine), lemon juice, and capers to the pan. Use a spatula to
                            scrape up the browned bits. Reduce the sauce by half.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Whisk in the remaining butter:
                        </h3>
                        <p>Whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Serve immediately:
                        </h3>
                        <p>Plate the chicken and serve with the sauce poured over the chicken. Sprinkle with parsley.
                        </p>
